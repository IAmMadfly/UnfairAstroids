# Unfair Astroids

Game entry for [Bevy Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1)

# Game Idea

- Astroids like game with two players
- Enemies and astroids enter the play space and destroied for points tokens.
- A single advantage orb exits that puts a player ship into overdrive mode making them more powerfull but also in danger (think dark packt)
  - Fire mor bullets
  - Larger point collection field
  - Saps health
  - Steels health from enemies that they kill
  - Are forced to drop the Advantage orb if there are not enough enemies to kill making it available for the other player to steal
